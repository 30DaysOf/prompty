# 1. Introduction

Building production-ready generative AI applications involves 3 stages:

- **Ideation** - rapid prototyping, testing apps with simple test prompts.
- **Augmentation** - evaluation, testing quality & safety with larger datasets.
- **Operationalization** - deploying apps and monitoring them for insights.

The challenge is in providing developers with a developer experience and tooling support to streamline these stages - without requiring a massive learning curve in new semantics, model-specific APIs or plaform-specific SDKs. 

What if we could make the **prompt** the central unit of development - and build tooling to build agency and observability around it? That's the vision behind Prompty. Watch this Microsoft Build 2024 session for a deeper dive into end-to-end AI development using Prompty and AI Studio.



Using Prompty you can:

 - **Design Prompts** - Create & refine prompt templates in an IDE
 - **Explore Models** - Configure model parameters, diverse deployments
 - **Execute Prompts** - Use built-in tools and custom runtimes to test prompts
 - **Observe Traces** - Use built-in features to track and debug execution
 - **Compose Apps** - Chain and compose Prompty assets for complex flows
