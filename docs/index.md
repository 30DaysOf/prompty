# Welcome

[Prompty](https://prompty.ai) is a new type of **executable asset** that provides agency with observability during the **ideation** phase of your generative AI application development lifecycle.

Using Prompty you can:

 - **Design Prompts** - Create & refine prompt templates in an IDE
 - **Explore Models** - Configure model parameters, diverse deployments
 - **Execute Prompts** - Use built-in tools and custom runtimes to test prompts
 - **Observe Traces** - Use built-in features to track and debug execution
 - **Compose Apps** - Chain and compose Prompty assets for complex flows


## Learning Objectives

??? note "1. Core Concepts"
    - Prompty Specification
    - Prompty Tooling
    - Prompty Runtime

??? note "2. Prompty Quickstart"

    - Create a new Prompty asset
    - Configure asset with a model
    - Configure asset with a prompty template
    - Execute asset with a hardcoded input

??? note "3. Prompt Engineering"

    - By modifying model parameters
    - By modifying system context
