# Overview

This workshop is designed to provide a beginner level introduction to Prompty features and usage - with hands-on exercises and a pre-build development environment for a quick start.

## 0. Prerequisites

To get the most from this workshop, you should have:

- A GitHub account (personal)
- An Azure account (for some labs)
- Familiarity with Python
- Familiarity with Visual Studio Code
- Familiarity with Generative AI concepts

## 1. What Is Prompty?

[Prompty](https://prompty.ai) is a new type of **executable asset** that provides agency with observability during the **ideation** phase of your generative AI application development lifecycle.

Using Prompty you can:

 - **Design Prompts** - Create & refine prompt templates in an IDE
 - **Configure Models** - Specify model parameters, work with diverse targets
 - **Execute Prompts** - Use built-in tools and custom runtimes to test prompts
 - **Observe Traces** - Use built-in features to track and debug execution
 - **Compose Apps** - Chain and compose Prompty assets for complex flows


## 2. Learning Objectives

By the end of the workshop, you should be able to accomplish these objectives:

### 2.1  Understand Core Concepts

- Prompty Specification
- Prompty Tooling
- Prompty Runtime

### 2.2 Build First Prompty

- Create a new Prompty asset
- Configure asset with a model
- Configure asset with a prompty template
- Execute asset with a hardcoded input

### 2.3 Do Prompt Engineering

- By modifying model parameters
- By modifying system context
- By modifying prompt instructions
- By adding grounding context

### 2.4 Configure Models

Refactor prompty asset to use models sourced from:
- GitHub Marketplace
- Open AI 
- Azure OpenAI 
- Azure AI Model Catalog (serverless API)
- LlamaIndex 

### 2.5 Trace Prompty Execution

- Instrumenting assets for tracing
- Viewing trace logs in the Prompty UI

### 2.6 Test Prompty assets

- With a sample data file
- With hardcoded data inputs
- With interactive data inputs from CLI

### 2.7 Compose Prompty assets

- Chain prompty assets for evaluation
- Chain prompty assets for orchestration

### 2.8 Evaluate Prompty assets

- By writing custom evaluators
- By running evaluators with test data
- By assessing quality with test data
- By running evaluators with adversarial data
- By assessing safety with adversarial data

### 2.9 Continue Learning

- Explore advanced samples
- Explore relevant resources
- Watch breakout sessions
